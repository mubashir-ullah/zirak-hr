# Supabase Migration Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Preparation and Backup

1. **Create a Git Branch**
   - Create a new branch for the migration to isolate changes
   - This allows for easy rollback if needed

2. **Backup the Current Codebase**
   - Create a complete backup of the current working codebase
   - Export any critical MongoDB data that might be needed for reference

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all Supabase environment variables are properly set
   - Confirm that both MongoDB and Supabase connections work (for the transition period)

## Phase 2: Apply API Migrations

1. **Run Migration Script**
   - Execute the migration script to apply all changes
   - Monitor for any errors during the process
   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-api-migrations.js
   ```

2. **Verify File Replacements**
   - Check that all original files have been backed up with `.bak` extension
   - Confirm that all `.migrated` files have been properly applied

3. **Update Import Statements**
   - Check for any import statements that might still reference MongoDB models
   - Update any remaining references to use the new Supabase functions

## Phase 3: Testing Strategy

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test user registration with email verification
   - Verify login functionality with email/password
   - Test social login providers (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Apple)
   - Verify password reset flow
   - Test account linking functionality

2. **Job Management Testing**
   - Create new job postings as a hiring manager
   - Edit and update existing job postings
   - Test job search and filtering
   - Verify job application process as a talent

3. **Profile Management Testing**
   - Create and update talent profiles
   - Test skill management functionality
   - Verify profile completion tracking

4. **Notifications Testing**
   - Verify notifications are created for relevant events
   - Test notification marking as read
   - Check notification counts and filtering

5. **Analytics Testing**
   - Verify event tracking functionality
   - Test analytics reporting endpoints
   - Check job performance metrics

## Phase 4: Remaining API Routes Migration

We've discovered additional API routes that still contain MongoDB references. These need to be migrated before we can fully remove MongoDB:

1. **Admin Routes**
   - `/api/admin/promote-user/route.ts` - For promoting users to admin role
   - `/api/admin/users/route.ts` - For managing users in admin dashboard

2. **Analytics Routes**
   - `/api/analytics/applications/route.ts` - For application analytics
   - `/api/analytics/departments/route.ts` - For department analytics

3. **Talent Skills Routes**
   - `/api/talent/skills/verified/route.ts` - For verified skills
   - `/api/talent/skills/route.ts` - For managing skills
   - `/api/talent/search/route.ts` - For searching talent profiles
   - `/api/talent/save/route.ts` - For saving talent profiles

4. **Test Route**
   - `/api/test/route.ts` - For testing database connection

## Phase 5: MongoDB Removal

1. **Identify MongoDB Dependencies**
   - Search for remaining MongoDB imports and references
   ```bash
   grep -r "mongodb\|mongoose" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .
   ```

2. **Remove MongoDB Connection File**
   - Once testing confirms everything works, remove the MongoDB connection file
   - Update package.json to remove MongoDB-related dependencies

3. **Clean Up Environment Variables**
   - Remove MongoDB URI from environment variables
   - Document the changes in the project README

## Phase 6: Final Verification and Documentation

1. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Perform a complete user journey test
   - Verify all critical paths work as expected

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update the project README with Supabase information
   - Document the new database structure and API endpoints
   - Create a migration summary for future reference

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Set up monitoring for the new Supabase-based API routes
   - Compare performance metrics with the previous MongoDB implementation

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Estimated Time | Dependencies |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Preparation | 1 hour | None |
| Phase 2: Apply Migrations | 2 hours | Phase 1 |
| Phase 3: Testing | 4-6 hours | Phase 2 |
| Phase 4: Remaining API Routes Migration | 2 hours | Phase 3 |
| Phase 5: MongoDB Removal | 1 hour | Phase 4 |
| Phase 6: Documentation | 2 hours | Phase 5 |

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. Restore the original files from the `.bak` backups
2. Revert to the pre-migration Git branch
3. Keep MongoDB connection active until all issues are resolved
