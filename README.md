# Zirak HR: AI-Based HR Innovation App

## Overview
Zirak HR is an AI-powered HR innovation platform designed to streamline the hiring process by connecting IT professionals in Pakistan with hiring managers in Germany. The platform leverages advanced AI technologies, including Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate candidate assessments, job matching, and profile management. Zirak HR aims to make hiring faster, fairer, and more efficient while promoting sustainable and eco-friendly practices through green coding.

## Key Features

### For HR Managers:
- **AI-Powered Candidate Matching**: Automatically matches candidates to job openings based on skills, experience, and job requirements.
- **Advanced Search Filters**: Filter candidates by skills, location, German language proficiency (A1-B2), visa status, and availability.
- **Live Talent Pool**: Access a real-time database of candidates with up-to-date availability and profiles.
- **Bias-Free Recruitment**: Ensures hiring decisions are based solely on skills and qualifications, eliminating subjective biases.

### For Job Seekers:
- **1-Click Signup**: Sign up using Apple ID, GitHub, LinkedIn, or Google.
- **AI-Driven Profile Creation**: Automatically create profiles by uploading a resume or importing from LinkedIn.
- **AI-Powered Job Recommendations**: Receive tailored job recommendations based on skills and experience.
- **Skill Assessments**: Take AI-generated skill tests to improve visibility to recruiters.

### Eco-Friendly Practices:
- **Green Coding**: Optimized algorithms and cloud infrastructure to minimize energy consumption.
- **Sustainable Development**: Focus on reducing the environmental impact of AI technology.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js + Next.js**: For a fast, responsive, and SEO-friendly user interface.
- **Material-UI (MUI) and Tailwind CSS**: For modern and customizable UI components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For global state management.

### Backend:
- **Next.js API Routes**: For serverless API endpoints.
- **Supabase**: For authentication, database, and storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: For relational data storage via Supabase.
- **Python**: For AI/ML model integration and backend processing.

### AI/LLM Integration:
- **Deep Seek API**: For resume parsing, skill assessments, and job matching.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Fine-tuned for resume parsing and profile creation.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For custom AI models (if needed).
- **JobBERT Model**: JobBERT (jjzha/JobBERT) is a specialized transformer-based model adapted from the BERT architecture (bert-base-cased), specifically tailored for skill extraction from English job postings. It has undergone extensive domain-specific pre-training on approximately 3.2 million sentences from job advertisements, enhancing its understanding of employment-related language and terminology.
- **Apizhai/Albert-IT-JobRecommendation**: A lightweight transformer model built on ALBERT, optimized for job recommendation tasks. It was pre-trained using job-resume matching datasets in the IT sector, making it highly suitable for predicting job titles from resume text.

### Cloud & Deployment:
- **AWS/GCP**: For scalable, secure, and energy-efficient cloud hosting.
- **Docker + Kubernetes**: For containerization and orchestration to support scalability.

## Database Migration
Zirak HR has successfully migrated from MongoDB to Supabase to leverage Supabase's built-in authentication, real-time capabilities, and PostgreSQL database. The migration included:

### Key Components Migrated:
1. **Authentication System**: Replaced NextAuth.js with Supabase Auth
2. **Database Schema**: Created equivalent tables in Supabase for all MongoDB collections
3. **API Routes**: Updated all API routes to use Supabase client instead of MongoDB
4. **Storage**: Implemented file storage using Supabase Storage

### Benefits of Migration:
- **Improved Performance**: PostgreSQL's robust query capabilities enhance application performance
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Supabase's real-time subscriptions enable instant updates
- **Simplified Authentication**: Built-in auth with social providers streamlines user management
- **Row-Level Security**: Enhanced data protection with PostgreSQL's RLS policies
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single platform for auth, database, and storage reduces integration complexity



## System Architecture
Zirak HR follows a three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend (User Interface)**: Built with React.js and Next.js for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend (Business Logic & API Layer)**: Powered by Node.js and Express.js for efficient request handling.
- **Database Layer**: Supabase for storing user profiles, job postings, and AI-generated insights.
- **AI Processing Unit**: Dedicated AI module for resume parsing, job matching, and skill assessments.
